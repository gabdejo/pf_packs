Description: An R Interface to 'Bloomberg' is provided via the 'Blp API'.
SystemRequirements: A valid Bloomberg installation. The API headers and
        dynamic library are downloaded from
        <https://github.com/Rblp/blp> during the build step. See
        <https://bloomberg.github.io/blpapi-docs/cpp/3.8> as well as
        <https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/support/api-library/>
        for API documentation. A recent-enough compiler with C++11
        support is required.
