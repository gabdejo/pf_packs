Description: Functions are provided for the density function,
	     distribution function, quantiles and random number
	     generation for the skew hyperbolic
	     t-distribution. There are also functions that fit
	     the distribution to data. There are functions for the
	     mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis and mode of a given
	     distribution and to calculate moments of any order about
	     any centre. To assess goodness of fit, there are
	     functions to generate a Q-Q plot, a P-P plot and a tail plot.
